This is the Recommendations microservice for the NYU DevOps Fall 2025 eCommerce project.

## Overview

The Recommendations service manages product-to-product relationships to provide intelligent product suggestions to customers. It implements a REST API that supports __creating__, __reading__, __updating__, __deleting__, and __listing__ recommendation relationships between products.

The `/service' folder contains files for the database model and the service. The `/test` file separately contains files for testing the model and the service.

All API endpoints in this service return __JOSN__-formatted responses, including those error messages.

## Setup

Clone the repository and open it in VSCode:
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:CSCI-GA-2820-FA25-001/recommendations.git
    cd recommendations
    code .
```
If using the VSCode Remote Container, please click the automated poped-up instruction "Reopen in Container".

## Run the Service
```bash
flask run
```
Once running, open the browser and visit the corresponding localhost.

## Test the Codes
All tests are located in the /tests folder:
* test_models.py - tests the data model
* test_routes.py - tests the REST API routes
* factories.py - creates fake data for testing

__Run all tests__:
```bash
flask db-create
make test
```

__Run linter for PEP8 style__
```bash
make lint
```

This project follows Test-Driven Development(TDD) pratices and includes complete model and route tets with at lease 95% code coverage.
